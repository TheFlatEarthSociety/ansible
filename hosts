# The peering logic for this group is as follows:
#
#  1. There should be an intercontinental link between atl1 and lon1 (the
#     nearest two peers from each region). It does not matter in which direction
#     this is established, so we arbitrarily select atl1 -> lon1.
#
#  2. There should be an intracontinental link between each of (atl1, ord1) and
#     (fra1, lon1). It is convenient to have this initiated from the peer
#     uninvolved in the intercontinental link in (1), because of (3).
#
#  3. When atl1 or lon1 goes down, a new intercontinental link must be formed by
#     the remaining peer on its continent to avoid a netsplit. This is achieved
#     by having it fall back to the nearest peer on the other continent.
#
# This approach ensures that there are no cycles in the network, and that the
# loss of any one node cannot result in a netsplit. However, some two-node
# failure scenarios can still produce a netsplit.
