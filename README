The Flat Earth Society ansible management repo.

Currently, there is only just enough here to bootstrap an EC2 instance
that has been built using our AMIs (see the make-openbsd-ami and
make-openbsd-sets repos).

Usage:

  $ ./bootstrap NAME AZ

NAME can be anything you'd like, and currently is only used to tag the
instance in EC2. AZ must be an availability zone within a region where
we have an AMI (currently only ap-southeast-2).
