Building a server
-----------------

We build all stateless servers from scratch for every OpenBSD release rather
than upgrading them to ensure our provisioning process works.

The process is as follows, for a Vultr VPS. These FES-specific notes are
intended to be read in conjunction with the OpenBSD FAQ
<https://www.openbsd.org/faq/> if you are unfamiliar with the OpenBSD
installation process.

  1. Boot the host into the new ISO using the Vultr console. Alternatively,
     you can fetch bsd.rd and boot that, but the ISO has the sets already
     downloaded. Either method is fine.

  2. At the prompt, select (I)nstall. Most configuration questions can be left
     as default or be given obvious answers (such as the machine hostname).

     Things to note:
       a) networking is autoconf for both IPv4 and IPv6
       b) set the root password to something temporary for now
       c) say no to running the X Window System
       d) say no to setting up a user (we'll do that ourselves below)
       e) say no to root login over ssh
       f) timezone is UTC

  3. For partitioning, use your brain regarding the host's role. If there are
     existing hosts with a similar role, you can look at those for
     inspiration, but before copying their layout, take a look at their disk
     usage and see if their partitioning makes sense for their actual usage.

     As a general guideline, allocate around 500M for /, 2G for /usr and 2-5G
     for /usr/local. /home and /var will vary according to what kinds of
     things the host will be doing. Do not create a /tmp partition, as we will
     use mfs for that.

     Remember that you do not need to allocate the whole disk if you don't
     need it. Having some unallocated space gives you more flexibility later.

  4. Install all the sets. No exceptions.

     If you are installing from an ISO, it is ok to agree to continue without
     verification of the sets. If you fetched them over the network, they
     *must* be verified.

  5. Before rebooting, drop into a shell and configure domain name, /tmp and
     IPv6 networking:
       echo <hostname>.tfes.org >/mnt/etc/hostname
       sed -i 's/inet6 autoconf/inet6 autoconf -temporary -soii/' \
         /mnt/etc/hostname.*
       echo swap /tmp mfs rw,-s128M,noatime,nodev,nosuid 0 0 >>/mnt/etc/fstab
       reboot

  6. Log in as root on the console, using the temporary password you set.
     Apply any pending syspatches:
       syspatch

  7. Look up your uid in roles/users/vars/user:your_username.yml in this repo,
     and create your user with enough access to run ansible:
       useradd -mG wheel -u your_uid your_username
       echo permit nopass :wheel >/etc/doas.conf

  8. Set a temporary password on your user:
       passwd your_username

     Then, log in over ssh, verifying the host key fingerprint by entering (on
     the console):
       ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key

     Immediately set the root password to the (randomly generated) permanent
     one now that you can easily copy and paste it:
       doas passwd root

     (The means of recording passwords is outside the scope of this document.)

  9. Install Python (ansible's only prerequisite):
       doas pkg_add python%3

     If there are multiple version options, you should generally select the
     default one. (TODO: How does one determine the default?)

  10. Create an SSH key for syncing TLS keys:
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f .ssh/id_ed25519.acme

      Configure palpatine (legacy server) to accept this key. This is
      undocumented; ask xasop.

  10. Run ansible by invoking (in this repository):
        make hostname

      Replacing `hostname` with the hostname of the machine, of course.
      Optionally, you can copy your ssh key to the machine first. In any case,
      ansible will ensure that your ssh key is present and that your user has
      no password.

 11. Configure palpatine (legacy server that performs DKIM signing) to permit
     the new host to relay mail. Depending on the host's role, there may be
     other access required as well.

     This is undocumented and you very likely do not have the necessary
     permissions to do it. If you are not xasop, simply ask xasop.

 12. Re-run ansible to confirm that it believes the state of the host is
     consistent. That is, the play recap should indicate that all actions are
     either ok (no change) or skipped (not applicable to this host).

 13. Reboot the host to apply any boot-time configuration that ansible
     installed.
